# AI-Personal-Trainer

(i) Problem definition
For the last two years, Covid-19 has been a disaster for our world and categorized
as a pandemic, many people stayed home and couldn’t keep their healthy lifestyle
running like going to the gym, etc. Some athletes couldn’t keep their bodies as fit and
healthy as before this quarantine.

(ii) Approach and tools/techniques
In this project, we built an Al Trainer program using OpenCV and Python. We used
the pose estimation to find the correct points and place them in live video of the user’s
body then the model draws lines between the points to detect body shape so it can
help the model to calculate the angles of every move. By comparing the incoming
angles with the desired ones, the model can know if they are fully right or not which
helps the program to increase the number of counts.

(iii)Overview of system modules
A Cross-platform system that runes in a web application backed by firebase
which deals with an AI python model that responses to every incoming data by
analyzing it and sending the results back to the web application.

2. Impact
Why do you consider this project? What is its impact on community/market/end-user/…?
Our project can be used for multiple purposes like a method for the user to communicate with an online hired
coach who can give the user a workout plan and diet. We also believe it can be used in the Rehabilitation of our
soldiers.
We also made our program a self-trainer so the user can input his BMI (Body Mass Index)and receive the
best plan based on the inserted data. And also it can check if the user doing the workout set right or not

3. Novelty and Features
Explain (i) novelty (ii) features, and (iii) related products, if any.

(i) Novelty
Unlike some instructions or an app that tells you a workout plan. our project is like your very own personal
trainer. It can make a special workout plan for you and track your progress and determine your accuracy in
training movement

(ii) Features
Our project will be available for all kinds of people and ages in our community. Not only for athletes. And it’s
online and easy to use
